Installing takes around 10 - 15 minutes depending on whether your HDD can transfer GB's of data at a moderate speed.
###Install - Part 1
Firstly before installing the server software, create a file in your chosen location of where you want the server files to be located create a new folder titles 'DayZ Private Server' or something along those lines. After, copy the ArmA 2 directory from either:

* C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\ArmA 2\
  or
* C:\Program Files\Bohemia Interactive\ArmA 2\

If you're on a 64-Bit OS then append 'x86' to the end of the Program Files directory.

Same applies for ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead, copy the contents into the same folder as the one you just created along with the ArmA II files, overwriting if necessary.
###Install - Part 2
After merging both directories, download the latest release from the GitHub master repo then copy the contents of the downloaded files into the directory where you merged both ArmA II and ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead to make ArmA II: Combined Operations. Your folder structure should contain the following directories:

    /serverfolder/Addons/
    /serverfolder/BattleEye/
    /serverfolder/cfgdayz/
    /serverfolder/@dayz/
    /serverfolder/@hive/
    /serverfolder/MySQL/
